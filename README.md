I don't know the approach "Logic" on it but I do it as I understand it. {
- If you want to add "say Spices" : 
  - click on "بهارات" it will appear all items on it and you can choose any item "multiple choices".
  - after that a new section named "بهارات" will appear and contains all items you choice.
  - and so on with another sections "المكرونات , .... ".
}. If that approach isn't correct please let me know.

The first section its background is a degree of red color, but in design the rgb is a degree of blue color.

This is an online version to see it on mobile..
